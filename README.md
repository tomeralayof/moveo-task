Project Summery:

runnig code:
To run the code on your browser and play the looper you might download the zip folder from gitHub, open it on any edditor and run npm i on the terminal in order to pluggin the node module.

On Machine Looper project i have build a loop music machine. my goal was to build a machine which contains 9 pads which every single pad contain a diffrent sound while the player is able to control the sounds and make a cool music by playing with the pads and control the sounds.
Beside, the player is able to record his list and lister to it over and over.

The project contains 3 buttons and 9 pads(every pad has his own button to control the played music.)

Pad button:
The pad button is initially activates the specific pad which is clicked. Actually, it has some other roles:

1. enable the pad animation.
2. play the sound
3. double click will make the sound again inside the looper/

Reset button:
The reset button resets the looper and by clicking play straight forward it will not play the previous looper played.

Record button:
Recording the pattern and put the record inside a list below the looper.

Hope you all enjoyed playing with the looper!
